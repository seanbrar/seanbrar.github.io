This book is part of my reference collection for mathematical exploration beyond standard curricula.

**Why it's in my collection:** Carr's compendium fascinates me as both a mathematical resource and a historical artifact. I appreciate how it presents results without the artificial boundaries of modern course divisions, revealing unexpected connections between topics. I often browse it when stuck on a problem, finding that these historical perspectives frequently suggest elegant approaches that aren't emphasized in contemporary texts. It serves as a reminder that mathematics is a continuously evolving human endeavor rather than a fixed body of knowledge.

_As a reference work, this book serves as an ongoing resource rather than a text to be worked through sequentially._
