This book is part of my planned mathematical study essential for machine learning and AI research.

**Why it's in my collection:** I selected Friedberg's text specifically for its theoretical approach to linear algebra after researching alternatives like Strang and Axler. Linear algebra forms the mathematical backbone of most machine learning techniques, and I want to understand these concepts at a fundamental level rather than just their applications. I'm particularly interested in developing a deeper intuition for eigendecomposition and singular value decomposition, as these techniques appear repeatedly in dimensionality reduction and recommendation systems I hope to work with.

*A detailed reflection will be added after I complete this book.*
