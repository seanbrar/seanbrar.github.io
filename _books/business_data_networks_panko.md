# Description
description_short: Practical insights into network architecture that inform my understanding of distributed systems.
---

This book is part of my curated collection highlighting my technical background in systems and networks as it relates to my AI research goals.

**Why it's in my collection:** My experience as a systems engineer was fundamentally shaped by this text's framework for understanding network architecture. The book's approach to analyzing security boundaries and data flow patterns gave me a systematic way to think about distributed systems. This background directly influences how I approach AI deployment challenges, particularly in thinking about data pipelines, system boundaries, and fault tolerance in machine learning infrastructure. The network perspective remains valuable even when working with higher-level abstractions.

*A more detailed reflection on this book will be added as I continue developing this section of my site.*
