This book is part of my curated collection highlighting interdisciplinary influences on my thinking about technology and society.

**Why it's in my collection:** Diamond's environmental determinism framework fundamentally changed how I think about technological development. By analyzing how geographic factors shaped technological trajectories across civilizations, he offers a compelling model for understanding technology as embedded within broader systems rather than developing in isolation. This systems perspective informs how I approach AI research - not just as a technical discipline, but as a field whose trajectory will be shaped by educational systems, resource distribution, and societal values.

*A more detailed reflection on this book will be added as I continue developing this section of my site.*
