This book is part of my planned study in probabilistic reasoning essential for machine learning and AI.

**Why it's in my collection:** I selected Ross's text for its balance between theoretical rigor and accessibility in probability theory. My research into machine learning prerequisites consistently pointed to the importance of strong probability foundations - particularly for understanding concepts like maximum likelihood estimation and probabilistic graphical models. Rather than learning these concepts piecemeal through ML tutorials, I want to build a coherent foundation first through this systematic treatment of probability, random variables, and distributions.

*A detailed reflection will be added after I complete this book.*
