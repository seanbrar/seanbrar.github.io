> What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.

Books have been essential to my intellectual development - from the mathematical foundations supporting my transition to AI research to works that challenge how I think about technology's broader implications. This collection reflects both my current technical focus and the interdisciplinary perspectives that inform it. My mathematical texts represent the rigorous foundation I'm building, while the diverse works in computer science, philosophy, history, and fiction provide the context and creative inspiration that keep my technical work grounded in human concerns and possibilities. Each selection has influenced how I approach problems, understand systems, or consider the societal dimensions of emerging technologies.
