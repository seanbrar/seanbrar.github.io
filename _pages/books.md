> What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.

Books have been essential to my intellectual journey - from mathematical foundations that support my transition to AI research to works that challenge my thinking about technology's role in society. This collection reflects both my current path and future aspirations. Each selection has shaped my approach to problem-solving, systems thinking, and the ethical dimensions of emerging technologies. While my mathematical texts form the core of my current studies, the interdisciplinary works and stories featured here provide the context and creative inspiration that inform my technical work.
