I'm currently a systems engineer at ELEMENTS, an enterprise media solutions provider.

I work with a fantastic team, tackling challenges across the entire technology stack to empower our clients to create remarkable things.

I graduated summa cum laude from [CSULA](https://www.calstatela.edu/) with a Bachelor's degree in Political Science and a minor in Computer Information Systems. Since then, I've earned CompTIA A+ and Network+ certifications and completed a certificate program in AI Strategy from Cornell University.

I take pride in problem-solving and creating new solutions with the latest technologies. As I continue to grow, I remain dedicated to leveraging technology to solve problems and positively impact the world.

Iâ€™ve recently started a blog called [Dreaming Ideas](/blog) to explore these interests further.
