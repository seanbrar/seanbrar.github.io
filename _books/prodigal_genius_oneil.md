This book is part of my curated collection highlighting innovative thinkers who inspire my approach to technical work.

**Why it's in my collection:** O'Neill's biography of Tesla resonated with me beyond just appreciating Tesla's technical achievements. What struck me most was Tesla's capacity for mental visualization - his ability to construct and test entire systems in his mind before building physical prototypes. While I don't claim similar abilities, this account inspired me to develop my own visualization and abstract reasoning skills, practices I find valuable when conceptualizing complex systems or algorithmic approaches before implementation.

*A more detailed reflection on this book will be added as I continue developing this section of my site.*
