## Background

This personal website and blog serves as a platform to showcase my work, share my thoughts on a variety of subjects, and provide updates on any projects I'm working on. The site is built using the 'al-folio' Jekyll template, which offers a clean and customizable design perfect for academic and professional portfolios.

Rather than self-hosting, this website utilizes GitHub Pages for easy deployment and maintenance. Additionally, Cloudflare is used for DNS management, CDN services, and bot protection, ensuring optimal performance and security.

## Install

For detailed installation and deployment instructions, please refer to the INSTALL.md file in this repo. This document provides comprehensive guidance on setting up the project locally and deploying it to GitHub Pages.

## Credits

- Website template: [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) Jekyll theme
- Icons: [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)

## Contributing

If you notice any problems with the website or have suggestions for improvements, please open an [issue](https://github.com/seanbrar/seanbrar.github.io/issues) on GitHub. Your feedback is valuable and helps improve the site.

This website is based on the 'al-folio' Jekyll theme. If you're interested in contributing to the development of the theme itself, I encourage you to check out the [original al-folio repository](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) and consider contributing there. Your contributions can help improve the theme for all its users.

Please note that due to the personal nature of this website, I am not accepting direct pull requests for content or major design changes at this time. However, I greatly appreciate your interest and support!
