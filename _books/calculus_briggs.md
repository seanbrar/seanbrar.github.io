This book is part of my planned mathematical progression toward the advanced mathematics required for AI research.

**Why it's in my collection:** I've chosen Briggs' text as my entry point into calculus for its balanced approach to both computation and theory. Rather than jumping directly into more abstract treatments, I want to build intuition through this more approachable text first. My research indicates this sequence (starting with computational understanding before moving to theoretical depth) will give me a stronger foundation for later tackling the optimization problems central to machine learning algorithms. The book's emphasis on applications will help me connect abstract concepts to practical implementations.

*A detailed reflection will be added after I complete this book.*
