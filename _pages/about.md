I'm an independent AI researcher focused on large language models, context handling, and retrieval-augmented generation systems.

Previously, I worked as a systems engineer at ELEMENTS (an enterprise media solutions provider), where I gained valuable experience working across the technology stack for media production environments.

I graduated summa cum laude from [CSULA](https://www.calstatela.edu/) with a Bachelor's degree in Political Science and a minor in Computer Information Systems. My technical education has continued with completing a certificate program in AI/ML from Caltech, an AI Strategy certificate from Cornell University, and earning CompTIA A+ and Network+ certifications.

My recent work includes developing [ContextRAG](https://github.com/seanbrar/ContextRAG), a system for context-aware retrieval processing, and [paperweight](https://github.com/seanbrar/paperweight), a tool for automated academic paper filtering and summarization. These projects reflect my passion for creating intelligent systems that can process and understand information at scale.

I take pride in solving complex problems at the intersection of AI research and practical applications. As an active member of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), I remain committed to contributing to the field's advancement.

Iâ€™ve recently started a blog called [Dreaming Ideas](/blog) to explore these interests further.
