# Description
description_short: A systematic analysis of AI risk that shaped my perspective on responsible technology development.
---

This book is part of my curated collection examining the broader implications of advanced AI development.

**Why it's in my collection:** While many dismiss long-term AI safety concerns as speculative, Bostrom's careful analysis helped me see the importance of considering these questions even in near-term research. The book's framework for analyzing intelligence explosion scenarios and control problems has informed my thinking about the responsible development of even narrow AI systems. I found its exploration of value alignment particularly thought-provoking - the challenge of building systems that reliably pursue human values remains relevant across all scales of AI development.

*A more detailed reflection on this book will be added as I continue developing this section of my site.*
