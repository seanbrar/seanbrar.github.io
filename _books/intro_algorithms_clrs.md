This book is part of my technical reference collection for algorithm design and analysis.

**Why it's in my collection:** CLRS has become my trusted companion when approaching algorithmic problems. Rather than using it as a textbook, I find myself regularly consulting specific chapters as needed - reviewing graph algorithms before tackling a network analysis problem, or refreshing my understanding of dynamic programming approaches when optimizing a particularly complex function. The book's rigorous treatment of correctness proofs and computational complexity provides the theoretical foundation I need when designing algorithms for machine learning applications.

*As a reference work, this book serves as an ongoing resource rather than a text to be worked through sequentially.*
